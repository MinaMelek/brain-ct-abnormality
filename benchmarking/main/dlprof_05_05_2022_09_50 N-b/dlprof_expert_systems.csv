Problem,Recommendation
"243 ops were eligible to use tensor cores but none are using FP16","Try enabling AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision). For more information: https://developer.nvidia.com/automatic-mixed-precision"
"The following GPU device IDs are not being used: 1 2 3","Make sure to pass the necessary options to docker, the framework, and the model to use all available GPUs"
"No DALI ops detected","Consider using NVIDIA DALI, a library that is a high performance alternative to built-in data loaders and data iterators. Learn more here: https://developer.nvidia.com/DALI"
"Unable to split profile into training iterations: key op  not found","Specify key op by setting the --key_op argument"
"PyTorch NVTX Context Manager was NOT detected.","PyTorch NVTX Context Manager is required to associate GPU performance data to the correct forward and backward propagation phase. Please add torch.autograd.profiler.emit_nvtx() to the training/inference loop. Refer to the DLProf User Guide for more information."
"GPU Memory is underutilized: Only 67% of GPU Memory is used","Try incrementally increasing batch size (by multiples of 8) to increase data throughput"
